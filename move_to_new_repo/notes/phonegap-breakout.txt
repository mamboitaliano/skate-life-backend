compiles your html, breaks it down and lets you put it on your phone

may need an ios developer key in order to use it on iphones

under the hood, it acts as your phone's native browser except that the browser bar is kind of sliced off at the top

it's like a 'pseudo-native-app'

there are a couple of files that we have to include to let phonegap know about the specifics of

aheinen - checkout repo and wheretoclient repo

tmp file needs to be included
there's a certain structure, format, and script tags that need to be included so check out the html page

Alex's group originally used jquery mobile and phonegap, but his group opinion was that jquery did give some nice features but was a pain to work with on the css front
--would have to use IMPORTANT to override some of the css
--jquery ui doesn't work well with jquery mobile, nor do any of the jquery applications

-see what else you can use to work with the front end

we could bulid jquery mobile in one html file where each button goes to a different id tag..?

-alex's project approach was a single page app that had a blank div in the html and used ajax to replace the contents of the div

-make use of the chrome dev tools to see how things are working mobile
-if things don't work, try closing chrome dev tools 
-do all of the designing on the phone
-look into responsive design for phones

for demo - consider recording, demo in devtools
-or screencast to the project from your phone

-separate backend and frontend into different repos
-host the rails app on heroku
-phonegap hosts our app
-have a global url in our javascripts
put localhost3000 in our javascript 
-when we switch to heroku, just change 1 link.
-figure out your oAuth right away
handle the oauth in our frontend
-facebook has good documentation for their javascript sdk
--request goes to javascript and back to the app


try to get the rails app on heroku asap
try to get a hello world app on phonegap rightaway
